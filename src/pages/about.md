My name is Daniel Uhl. I've moved a lot:

- Bozeman, MT

I live in Boston and work as a frontend focusted full-stack polyglot engineer for remote companies.

## Work

I've been coding for over 15 years and still going strong.

- Tech lead
- Platform team

- Engineering Manager

## What I use

I'm a VIM user. See my full computer setup in my [routines review](routines-review).

## Podcast (Luculent Lollygag)

I do a podcast with a few friends who I've worked with in the past. It's mostly about software
engineering but I reflect a lot of the ideas from this blog in that podcast. Check out luculent
lollygag on your favorite podcast platform.
