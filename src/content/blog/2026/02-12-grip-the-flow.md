I was at a friends kids birthday party. They were doing a song writing activity
where each kid follows inspirational instructions to write lyrics to their own
fun song. The inspirational instructions were written by the birthday boy
himself and were awesome! I only remember two of the steps he wrote, but they
really stuck with me.

Step 3: Look around the room; feel all the emotions around you.
<br />
Step 4: Grip the flow.

I'm sure there a ton of contexts where you can "grip the flow" but of course,
mindful practice came to mind for me. Mindfulness is feeling all of the current
moment. Like sitting beside a stream watching life flow past. This is dualistic
mindfulness, where you are separate from the experience. Non-dual practice
is when you _are_ the stream. Grip the flow.
