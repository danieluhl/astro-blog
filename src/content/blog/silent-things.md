description: How the things in our environment relate to our mind
---

A slow regard of silent things is many things to many people. It's more a verb than a noun, with no real beginning or ending. Something I personally took from it is to re-think the intentionality depth with which I interact with everyday objects. The difference between a mess and a well-designed clean space lies here. When approached with care and thoughtfulness, the items that make up our home-brewed habitat hold a mirror to our mind. Not only does this often delight the next person to walk into the room, but it initiates a positive feedback loop where one can delight in the beauty of their own making.
