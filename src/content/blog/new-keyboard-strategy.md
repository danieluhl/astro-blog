Glove80

I bought a [glove80](https://www.moergo.com/) keyboard and I'm slowly and a little painfully typing
this post about it because I'm confident I've worked out a layout scheme that's good enough to begin
mastering. My layout is, I'm confident, better for me than a standard keyboard layout. Mine
certainly will not work for many people so I wanted to write about my learning journey to hopefully
help others speed things up or give some ideas to try.

[My Layout](https://my.glove80.com/#/layout/user/286c60d0-1fed-4308-8689-15d181846aba)

For a little context: I do software engineering in vim and bounce to Arc browser and use chrome dev
tools quite a bit. I use shortcuts in almost every program I have. I use hyperkey plus raycast to
wire up programs directly to keys. In the past I've been using karabiner to modify `hjkl` to match
vim movement arrow keys (and I love having arrows here).

1. Feel things out first

Assuming you are a touch typer, sit with the keyboard disconnected and just type whatever comes to
you. Play though common patterns in your mind like swtiching betwen programs and doing all the
keyboard shortcuts that are most common.

This is going to give you very fast iteration in your mind about where you might want modifier keys
and what definitely won't work. From doing this I came up with my first two principles below.

2. Don't over optimize (principles 3-6)

It can be tempting to put all kinds of keyboard shortcuts and combos under individual keys when you
have so many open. The possibilities are endless and you can quickly go overboard. But consider the
tradeoffs. You likely want to remain reasonably proficient on a standard keyboard. You do not know
all keyboard shorcuts you'll need in the future and you probably don't want to be constantly
adjusting your layout years down the line.

It's more important to have a good way to do any possible combination, than a perfect way of only
doing a few and possibly getting stuck having to drag out another keyboard to un-stick yourself.

3. Have a logical ordering

At this point you should have at least a standard working keyboard you can optionally switch to. But
that's not why you spent $400 on a split ergo with six key thumb clusters :)

Focus on the most used patterns and how you can build them into the keyboard in a logical way. Here
was my though process:

I type numbers fastest with 10key layout so I want that on a layer. To more easily find symbols I
can place the corresponding symbols on numbers in another layer.

I switch tabs and programs very frequently but also want to index directly to a tab or program. So I
decided all indexing actions will be a right hand modifier with left hand key and vice versa for
"scrolling" like combos. For example, `cmd+shift+[` is easily pressed with a single thumb key on the
left plus bracets in the curl fingers on the right.

## Principles

1. Pulling the hands inward towards the thumbs is better than out to pinkies, modifiers move to the
   thumbs
2. The top two rows are completely optional, everything I use should be elsewhere
3. Never get stuck: have all modifies available on the base layer so in a pinch you can contort
   hands to hit the necessary keys
4. One way is better than several options
5. It's perfectly fine to leave as many keys blank as you like!
6. Don't stray from standard querty too far, I still want to be useful on my laptop
7. Scrolling on the right hand (left hand modifier), indexing directly on the left (e.g. tabs, arc
   spaces, applications, etc.)
8. No modtaps on fast keys, the delay will bite you

You'll note I don't entirely stick to these principles but thinking though them helped me get to a
point where I can start to practice and refine over time. After two days with the glove80 I'm back
to about 75 wpm (noramlly ~90) and I'm seeing how vim can be great with 10 key symbols under the
fingers at all times.
