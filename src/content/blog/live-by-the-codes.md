There's a great moment in "The Way of Kings" where Dalinar, the "black thorn", a
killing machine who loves the thrill of the fight, is in the middle of a battle
when he suddenly becomes overwhelmed by disgust at what he is doing. The magic
system in the book is based on oaths, codes, and honor, and Dalinar is being
guided in the right direction. Each book in the stormlight archive is also the
title of a book in the book. "The Way of Kings" is a book of old codes that
spell out how one should live.

After reading this I was inspired to make my own set of "codes to live by". The
idea is to look at sage wisdom from sources I trust, then reflect on my own
way of acting and living to see if there are just a few top virtues that I
struggle with. I landed on three:

## 1. Temperance

On The Skeptics' Guide podcast and on Science Based Medicine, Steve Novella
often repeats this one advice for nutrition: eat a wide variety, everything in
moderation. This simple advice that has been around for decades can save you
thousands of dollars and time and hassle with all sorts of fad diets and
supplements. It's not easy, but it is consistently effective. Your body and mind
will thank you.

However, with smaller behaviors it's easy to let this slip - eat just a little
too much candy or play a little too much video games here and there. Soon you'll
realize your whole day is taken up by endulgance.

Temperance relies heavily on mindfulness. You must be vigilant, self aware, and
act with integrity. Temperance for the skeptics goes all the way to regulating
thought, "control your thoughts, they shape your reality". It is to regulate
desiers and passions, avoid extremes, and most importantly, realize you can
transmute the wild energy of passion into love, community, and hard work.

## 2. Speak Mindfully

Never complain, even to yourself

Do not harbor hatred. Do not speak idly. Say what needs to be said at the right time, with full truth, affectionately, beneficially, and with a mind of good-will. Truthful, beneficial, altruistic, kind, timely.

Some public speakers or podcasters are clearly a level above others. It takes a
lot of practice to be good. What "good" means here is consciously choosing the
right words at the right times to convey accurately what you are trying to in
the fewest words possible. Obviously that leaves "um" and "like" out of the
sentences. But it also means expanding your vocabulary out to find better words.
It also means being good at reading the room. Is this a time to give ernest
praise? Is it a good time to land a bad joke?

Also, never complain.

## 3. Embrace Community

Put people first. Practice sympathetic joy, rejoicing in the happiness of others. Let go of anxiety.

Don’t waste time worrying about other people’s opinions. Don’t suffer imagined troubles. Don’t presume what others think of you.

Sympathetic joy is the opposite of jealousy or envy, you genuinely feel great
for others in their victories and expand their good feelings out to yourself and
then to the world.

For me community means fighting my social anxieties, reaching myself out into
the world to interact genuinely with people where they are. Try to break through
social walls that others put up to form a true connection, however brief. These
moments give life value and are increasingly hard to come by.
