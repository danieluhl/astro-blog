description: Scrum is wrong about pointing tickets

A bit of context before I begin: I have three official scrum master certifications and trained in a
dedicated one week course under Ken Schwaber himself. My brother is a full-time scrum master. I've
practices some form of scrum over the past 15+ years and I understand the tradeoffs in the space.
I'm here to tell you definitively that pointing tickets is a destraction at best.

Think about it carefully, if you're not building the right thing, it doesn't matter when it's done.
If you know you're definitely working on the right thing, it doesn't matter how long it's going to
take. If you're not sure the thing you're building is the right thing or not, it's time to shift
focus to figuring it out as quickly as possible.

This assumes you have a competent working engineering team focued on fast feedback, high quality,
and high speed. The job of a product team is to try as many variations as quickly as possible to
discover the best. The job of a software engineer on a product team is to build high quality code
fast. None of these require estimating tickets, building gantt charts, or sequencing timelines.

By putting estimates, tracking sprint capacity, and forecasting project timelines, we shift the
focus from solving customer problems to "the guessing game": carefully guessing how long things take
and striving to hit those commitments.

## But what about-

### Our stakeholders are making commitments to customers and we need to hit those timelines

In certain niche situations this may be true, if so I'd push towards a "Sprint" (the book) style of
work where time is the only thing that matters.

For 99% of teams there are two cases:

1. We can "bubble up" the sentiment that the business focues on priority not timelines and we can
   share our prioritized list with customers.
2. We can pull timelines out of thin air. The reasearch shows this is equally accurate as our best
   guess timelines. Product and stakeholders can look at the number of tickets and how many are done
   vs left and play their own guessing game if they want, no need to get engineers involved.

The issue here is that in most teams the org is too afraid to even try. What happens when they do is
they see their previously projected timelines become a joke. With the speedup engieners get from
cutting pointing ceremonies, product delivery gets so fast that the business can't keep up. "When" a
project is delivered doesn't matter when its so fast. Product starts collecting new features and
padding out release times to optimize the marketing side.

### Our lazy engineers will never get their job done without time pressure

If you're evaluating engineers on "the guessing game" you've already lost. You will have high
turnover, mediocre product, and constantly accumulating code debt. Great engineering teams build
high quality product fast. Part of _why_ they do so is that they cut out any activities that do not
support high quality code made fast. Pointing tickets is an early offender to be cut. It adds
friction and distraction and takes time and attention away from what matters for engineering and
product delivery.

### Our eng team has great conversations around pointing that we would miss

This is a great realization! How do you get those conversations without pointing? What you'll
quickly realize is that pointing is a crutch here. The meaningful conversation that happens after
pointing is actually where the conversation should start, you can skip everything before then and
just jump into meaningful conversation. It take some practice but saves 50% of many meeting times
when you get there.
